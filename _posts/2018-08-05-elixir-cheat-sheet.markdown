As an Elixir novice, I think one of the hardest things about getting started in
Elixir is figuring out what kind of data structures you want to use. Often,
I'll be reading over some of my team's code and have a hard time deciphering what I'm
even looking at. The syntax looks very similar to Ruby (which I know pretty
well), but the patterns, conventions, and data structures are just
_slightly_ different. It reminds me a lot of when I learned Spanish for the
first time and thought to myself, _this alphabet looks familiar, but there
are all these extra letters!_. Learning Elixir is kind of like that.

But anyway, since I'm learning Elixir now, I thought it'd be useful to
provide an overview of the differences in data structures I've noticed and give some helpful
hints along the way.

## Data Types

## Collection Types
- Tuples
- Lists
- Keyword Lists
- Maps
- Structs
- HashDicts
- Binaries
