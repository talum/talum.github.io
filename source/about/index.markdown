Hello! I'm Tracy Lum.

I graduated from the [Flatiron School](http://www.flatironschool.com) in December 2015. Currently, I work at [Learn.co](http://www.learn.co), which is made with love by the Flatiron School. Prior to officially learning how to code, I worked in publishing/podcasts/media/newspapers.

When I'm not programming, I'm probably writing, reading, learning languages, running, drinking coffee, or trying to learn more things. I'm a huge dork like that. 

You can find me online, pretty much anywhere online media is posted:
